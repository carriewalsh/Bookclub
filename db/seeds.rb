First, a drop about me from the standpoint of this book. I have been an IT professional for many years specializing in programming, database, and MS Office add-ons. Part of my job entails self enrichment, that is, expand my working knowledge in areas potentially important for my job. I chose Foreman's book to help with this task for a number of reasons: a) Data Science is a hot area and my company does have a Data Science group, b) I have lots of data experience under my belt - I felt that it would be nice for once to get some useful information from the data, and c) I have a really good Excel background - so I figured that Foreman's approach would be perfect for me - little did I know that I would seriously add to my Excel bag of tricks.")
r2 = b10.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Excellent title, but slightly disappointing content",rating: 3,review_text: "The first thing that strikes you as you read through the book is that it feels like a collection of essays and articles stretched into a book more than a fluid book itself. Indeed, Mastermind was based on a series of articles that the author wrote for two different web sites: Big Think and Scientific American.")
r3 = b17.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Low level introduction to Bayesian statistics and its applications",rating: 4,review_text: "This is a very accessible introduction to Bayesian statistics and its applications in economics and management science. The book would make an interesting and useful two semester course at the sophomore or junior level. The mathematical prerequisites are small - some calculus, but the book manages to introduce basic probability, stochastic processes, statistical inference, large sample theory, the multivariate normal distribution, and topics related to economics such as utility functions, lotteries, decision trees and portfolio theory.")
r4 = b19.reviews.create(username: "whiner",title: "Beware: Small Print",rating: 3,review_text: "I'm used to seeing Large Print featured as a plus for people with vision problems. This book needs to be clearly identified as Small Print. I understand and appreciate the technology of producing economical editions of out-of-copyright books, but buyers should be warned that books like this may require the use of a magnifying glass.")

I would strongly suggest this book for the beginners as well as intermediate level students.")
r7 = b16.reviews.create(username: "Alexander",title: "I’m not sure what to say...",rating: 4,review_text: "This was a very unique read! I enjoyed it very much. I decided to actually listen to the audio version after I read it, just to see if I would “rethink” my opinions and thoughts about the book. Then, I was so intrigued, I did some internet searches and started reading about other interpretations readers have made. I couldn’t get enough, I even went so far as to YouTube videos and feature length films dedicated to this short tale! Those proved to be quite interesting and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book!")
r8 = b11.reviews.create(username: "BookGirl1",title: "Good insights into practical data science",rating: 4,review_text: "This is a very good book to learn about the day-to-day life of data scientists, seen from the eyes of data science leaders at some of the leading companies such as FaceBook, LlinkedIn, and others. The interviews are very well done, asking a comprehensive set of questions consistently. The answers are long, nice and revealing of new ideas about how these leaders approach their work every day. Some of the interviewees are from M&A practitioners in this space, and don't necessarily belong in this collection. But overall this book is worth the money!")
r9 = b24.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Statistics in Context + Important Key Takeaways",rating: 4,review_text: "The author Nate Silver does a great job weaving more technical statistical concepts in context early in the book, so as not to lose readers early on. However I thought this would lead to more a detailed technical discussion later on, which the author said it would, but it never really transpired. Instead he kept to analogies and keeping the science of prediction in context. Which there's really nothing wrong with, if you're someone looking for that ... just not exactly what I wanted or expected.")

His thesis is clear from the introduction. Three hundred pages of documentation for the thesis is excessive. This is ivory tower gum flapping. You will get more from reading other reader's summaries and analysis, rather than suffering thru this on your own. I had to read it for class, otherwise I never would have. Read the summaries you can find elsewhere and you'll get the gist. Don't torture yourself. Nonetheless, his point is valid and insightful, just drowned in excessive detail and support. Just take his word for it and save yourself the hours required.")
r11 = b8.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Well Organized and Humorous Explanation of Randomness",rating: 5,review_text: "Math, history, and psychology all wrapped up in an often funny, and consistently well written 220 pages. It definitely falls into the page-turner category, and while there is some math, even the math phobic likely will enjoy it. Ironically, while the book focuses on the impact of randomness in world events and our personal lives, it is very well organized. Yet there is no reason why you shouldn't read the chapters in random order. Sure, there is some carryover from one chapter to the next, but if you read the last chapter first,  you might find yourself even more enlightened.")
r12 = b4.reviews.create(username: "BookGirl1",title: "still fun! While reading I just keep thinking to myself",rating: 4,review_text: "very interesting to read, although not so helpful in self-improvements, still fun! While reading I just keep thinking to myself, a lot of these conclusions were based on the law of large numbers, so a lot of more likely/less likely in there(if you know what I mean). I mean even if the percentage of occurrence of one thing is 1% higher than the other, you can say that's more likely to happen. But I personally think sometimes that's not anything worth concluding.")
r13 = b1.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Good idea; too bad about the errors",rating: 2,review_text: "The book is in general a good idea but has a fatal flaw - it has many math errors. It looks as if the authors took their lectures on signal theory and shoved them into a wavelet context, without stopping to consider what needs changing. It seems every two pages or so is a significant error. This would be ok *if* there were a published errata, but I have found none via google. What good is a book full of errors?")
r14 = b25.reviews.create(username: "Alexander",title: "less than what I had hoped",rating: 3,review_text: "This book falls somewhere between a manual page providing one example per function and a cookbook, tending more toward the former. Examples are dry and most are constructed using random data. There is very little in the way of practical use cases. I bought the book hoping to get some inspiration for using numpy and/or pandas for some types of analyses I find myself doing, but that didn't happen. Probably I've gathered enough overview that I now can put together useful queries that will provide useful hits on Stack Exchange. I wish I had better to say.")
r15 = b12.reviews.create(username: "BookGirl1",title: "There's a lot more going on there than what's on the surface.",rating: 4,review_text: "There's the obvious story, which is about Billy Pilgrim, a veteran and optometrist who is seemingly suffering from some sort of mental illness like PTSD from his time in the war, and also some sort of possible brain damage suffered from an airplane crash. These elements compound each other and Billy finds himself traveling through time to different points in his life; during his time in World War II, during his time with his wife Valencia, on a planet inhabited by the Tralfamadorians (who have him locked up as a human zoo exhibit), and a few others.")
r16 = b8.reviews.create(username: "BookGirl1",title: "The Right Balance of History, Philosophy, Mathematics and Popular Culture",rating: 5,review_text: "Although it’s seemingly impossible to discuss this book without drawing parallels to Fooled By Randomness, these books provide a great compliment to each other. This book in particular differs in its scope, traversing many areas outside of finance. It also speaks more directly to the reader, explaining the mathematics of probability by breaking down the mathematics (in contrast to Taleb who speaks more through analogies and metaphors).")
r17 = b13.reviews.create(username: "I'm a reader",title: "Terrible",rating: 1,review_text: "Who is the target audience for this book? It can't be professional mathematicians: they already know how theorems are born. It can't be lay people, either: the book is filled with unexplained jargon and equations. Villani desperately wants us to know how smart he is but has no interest in explaining anything.")
r18 = b15.reviews.create(username: "BookGirl1",title: "Historically Faulty and One Sided",rating: 3,review_text: "Does the author have any credentials as a historian or is this author a simply(eton) exercising his supposed talents as a historian - when in actuality - the exercise is closer to translating the various historians (nay! conniving camp followers) from the invaders side - negating any achievements of the Indian civilization - by simply saying that there was no cohesive defense against the invaders.")
r19 = b3.reviews.create(username: "I'm a reader",title: "Hundreds of typos in the math. AVOID THIS BOOK!",rating: 1,review_text: "I'm giving this 1 star because of all the typos. The typos are in the math, making you stumble and feel dumb for not getting it, until you realize there is a typo after mentally trying various corrections to see if one of them makes the answer work out. Oh... there's the typo! I d i o t s!")
r20 = b2.reviews.create(username: "Alexander",title: "Insightful, practical, and colorful. Perspective from a biased reviewer.",rating: 5,review_text: "Data Smart is none of these. Unlike Moneyball books, Data Smart contains enough practical information to actually start performing analyses. Unlike most textbooks, it doesn't get bogged down in mathematical notation. And unlike books about R or the distributed data blah-blah du jour, all the examples use good old Microsoft Excel. It's geared toward competent analysts who are comfortable with Excel and aren't afraid of thinking about problems in a mathematical way. It's goal isn't to revolutionize your business with million-dollar software, but rather to make incremental improvements to processes with accessible analytic techniques.")
r21 = b4.reviews.create(username: "Alexander",title: "Not a masterpiece but important inquiry",rating: 3,review_text: "The reason I do like this book is simple: the best economics is all about practical theory and applications, the original economists were trying to solve very simple problem such as how to keep people from abusing the common, is there enough food to go around, etc.")
r22 = b4.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Probably worth 4.5 stars",rating: 4,review_text: "Interesting and such a fun book, but surely you don't believe everything you read ? Here is a different perspective on several different sociologic topics important to our society. Many of its' tenets will be difficult to prove conclusively, but it is an eye opening look at counter-intuitive consequences of economic incentives. Overall ,the theme of intended consequences and surprising effects of various public policies holds true and makes for a compelling read.")
r23 = b3.reviews.create(username: "Book Worm",title: "Intimidating, yet rewarding comprehensive book.",rating: 5,review_text: "This book is truly a work of art. From his detailed to general knowledge about the history of mathematics, he gives the advanced mathematician an opportunity to see through the eyes of the great. This is not for beginners though. Even around mathematics majors and extremely high level scientists, many flee from the area when I pull this book out. It's thick and intimidating, but if you can sit and read parts of it at a time, it's greatly rewarding.")

This has left a bad taste of pandas in my mind. A lot of examples created in this book are using random numbers and this is a poor way of teaching someone as it's too abstract. Random number generated examples rarely have anything to do with data encountered in real life.")
r26 = b20.reviews.create(username: "Alexander",title: "Just historical",rating: 2,review_text: "I see people usually like this book. It is remarkable how much history of philosophy Heisenberg knows, however I don't really find a thesis here. Not like the principle of complementarity of Bohr. He makes parallels and shows how August Conte was wrong in the way that he didn't proclaim that science evolved of changes in language.")

Interesting reading it 50 years after it was published. It has passed the test of time. It is oddly engaging and unpredictable and just plain weird. This type of work can not be copied because it so utterly original. I can see how it was shocking in 1967 and was ultimately banned by some schools. Funny how that insured it would get the attention it deserved. This book retells the narrative of the WWII by someone who was there. Like all wars, I assume, there is absurdity, contradictions, unknown heros, small and big people that no one ever hears about. I have read a lot of books, fiction and non-fiction, about WWII and this book provided a colorful dynamic addition to all the thousands and thousands of books written on this subject. Where are all the Kurt Vonnegut's today? We need you so desperately.")

The first covering general principles reads a lot like a fairly advanced university level textbook and it got really tempting for me to give up on the book a number of times while reading that section which would have been a real pity since the second section covering Specific Topics in Software Engineering is far easier to read and a lot more interesting as well.")
