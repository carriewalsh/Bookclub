<section class="about-us">
  <p>The goal of our project was to get practice using MVC with Ruby on Rails. Our website has a database of books, authors, and reviews. The focus was on the many-to-many relationship functionality. As a user, you can add and delete books, add and delete reviews or peruse others' additions. </p>
